          <P>
            Oh I am very very happy that you have arrived here.<br>
             Thank you in advance.<br>
              I want to tell you about some of my simple and light projects<br> because I am still in the beginning of my life<br> and have not advanced to do big projects,
               but in the future you will see that, trust me.

    <li class="li-projects">The first project was the design of a program to reserve seats for the flight</li>
    <p>
        I will explain to you what this system is in general and how it works
This program enters a number of numbers according to what appears to you on the screen and you choose to show you all the seats and appear to 
 you and after you appear you see the empty seats and seats 
 reserved and choose the number if you enter a seized number
  with the error gives you that the number is reserved and so you can reserve as 
  you want seats when It ends appears that the reservation is over.

  I will put the file for you because I did not finish my studies at the university in order 
  to put a link to you to say that,
   but it is a very beautiful program and I won it with the best flying program<br><br>
